## Gem Studio: a desktop app for Windows

**Gem Studio** is a desktop app built on gem, so you can explore a Dota 2 replay without writing any code.
Open a `.dem` file and it shows the match as fights, objectives, lanes, runes, gold and XP, and wards.
No Python needed.

**[Download the latest installer](https://github.com/bilalfawadkhan/gem-dota-uI/releases/latest)** (Windows 10/11, 64-bit)
· [App guide](app/README.md) · [Implementation log](Implementation_log.md) · [Plan](UI-Implementation-plan.md)

> The installer is **not code-signed yet**. Windows may show "Windows protected your PC" (choose *More info*,
> then *Run anyway*), and Windows 11 *Smart App Control* can block it outright.

### What it does

- **Fight Replay & Dashboard.** The open fight's replay (map, health and mana, casts, damage) sits on the left
  (60%) and its fight log on the right (40%). **Previous / Next fight** arrows and a click on the timeline move
  between fights, and a button shows the map of all fights. Play, pause, 10-second steps, a seek slider and
  speeds from 0.25x to 4x, with keyboard shortcuts (Space, Ctrl+Left / Right).
- **Objectives, Lanes, Runes, Gold & XP Lead, Wards.** One tab for each: the docs site's figures, drawn from
  your replay.
- **A dashboard around them.** A roster for both teams (K/D/A, net worth), the match facts, and an
  **Analytical Telemetry** drawer (Ctrl+T) with the gold and XP advantage chart and sortable player and fight
  tables. Picking a fight or a player in one place updates the other.
- **Reads once, then remembers.** A replay is read in separate processes with a progress view (about 3 minutes
  the first time for a 36-minute match); the results are saved, so opening it again takes seconds.
- **Facts, not verdicts.** Like gem itself, it shows what happened and does not score plays.

### How it is built

A native PySide6 window with the docs site's figures shown in an embedded web view. The figures are built from
`site/` in place (never copied), and the two sides talk through a small Qt WebChannel bridge. All of the app's
code lives in [`app/`](app/), and the parser and the docs site are untouched, so upstream updates merge
cleanly. The Windows installer is made with PyInstaller and Inno Setup, and the packaged app is self-tested
before an installer is built. The decisions, bugs and measurements are written up step by step in the
[implementation log](Implementation_log.md).

<details>
<summary>Run it or build it yourself</summary>

```powershell
cd app
.\.venv\Scripts\python -m gemstudio my_match.dem         # run from source
cd ..
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File app\scripts\build_app.ps1   # build the exe and installer
```

Every command, including first-time setup, tests and the GitHub build, is in
[Rebuild-Readme.txt](Rebuild-Readme.txt) and the [app guide](app/README.md).

</details>

### Current limits

- Windows only, and unsigned (see the note above).
- A fight gets a map replay when it has 3 or more deaths; smaller fights show their log and timeline without the
  map.
- The *Scoreboard & Players* and *Batch & Parquet Export* tabs are placeholders for now.
- Hero and item icons and the map image belong to Valve Corporation. Gem Studio is not affiliated with or
  endorsed by Valve.

## gem: the replay parser

gem reads a replay the way the game recorded it: every entity update, combat-log
entry and chat event, rebuilt into one `ParsedMatch`. It runs offline, needs no API
keys, and handles both the old and new combat-log formats.

**Facts, not verdicts.** gem reports what happened: who was where, what they did,
what it cost and what followed. It doesn't score plays or decide whether a Roshan
"converted"; the [recipes](#recipes) show how to answer questions like that from the
facts, in code you can change.

## Install

gem needs Python 3.10 or newer.

```bash
# pip
pip install gem-dota

# uv (in a project)
uv add gem-dota

# uv (pip interface)
uv pip install gem-dota

# Poetry
poetry add gem-dota
```

Parquet export also needs `pyarrow` or `fastparquet`
([engine notes](https://whanyu1212.github.io/gem-dota/reference/dataframes)).

## Quickstart

```python
import gem

match = gem.parse("match.dem")

print(f"Score: {match.radiant_score}–{match.dire_score}")
for player in match.players:
    hero = gem.constants.hero_display(player.hero_name)
    print(f"{hero:20} {player.kills}/{player.deaths}/{player.assists}  {player.net_worth:,} NW")
```

No replay yet? `gem.fetch_replay(match_id, "replays/")` downloads and decompresses one
through OpenDota (Valve keeps replays for a limited time).

Prefer tables?

```python
frames = gem.parse_to_dataframe("match.dem")
frames["player_summary"]      # one row per player
frames["player_timeseries"]   # sampled gold, XP and net worth
frames["positions"]           # hero positions over time
frames["combat_log"]          # every normalized combat-log entry
```

Or the command line:

```bash
python -m gem match.dem
python -m gem match.dem --format json --output match.json
python -m gem batch replays/ --format parquet --output out/ --workers 4
```

## What you get

| Domain | Examples |
|---|---|
| Match and players | Score, winner, duration, teams, K/D/A, level, GPM/XPM, final net worth |
| Draft and objectives | Picks and bans, towers, barracks, Roshan and the Aegis, Tormentors, building status |
| Combat | The normalized combat log, damage and healing, kills, ability and item use, fights |
| Economy | Gold, XP and net-worth curves, minute-aligned advantages, purchases, a per-player gold ledger, exact buyback costs |
| Map | Hero positions, map regions, neutral camps, lane heatmaps, wards, smoke groups, couriers, runes |
| Items | Final inventories, neutral-item finds, consumed upgrades, Roshan drops, banner plants |
| Lookups | Position, net worth or ability level at a tick, nearby heroes, the fight at a tick, hero visibility |
| Exports | Dataclasses, DataFrames, JSON, Parquet, parallel multi-replay batches |

Good entry points:

- `gem.parse()` → `ParsedMatch`; `gem.parse_many()` for parallel batches
- `gem.parse_to_dataframe()`, `gem.to_json()` / `gem.load_json()`, `gem.to_parquet()`
- `gem.find_player()`, `gem.position_at_tick()`, `gem.fight_at_tick()`, `gem.region_of()`
- `gem.fetch_replay()` to download and decompress a replay by match ID

## Recipes

The [recipes](https://whanyu1212.github.io/gem-dota/cookbook/questions) answer one
question each from gem's facts and pandas. Every page has a figure for one match, the
answer across the test replays, and the code to run on yours:

- [Where were the fights, and who got the kills?](https://whanyu1212.github.io/gem-dota/cookbook/fights)
- [Where did each team ward, and what could the wards see?](https://whanyu1212.github.io/gem-dota/cookbook/wards)
- [How did each lane go?](https://whanyu1212.github.io/gem-dota/cookbook/lanes)
- [What moved the gold and XP lead?](https://whanyu1212.github.io/gem-dota/cookbook/lead)
- [When did each objective fall, and did teams convert their edges?](https://whanyu1212.github.io/gem-dota/cookbook/objectives)
- [Who took each rune, and what happened while a power rune lasted?](https://whanyu1212.github.io/gem-dota/cookbook/runes)
- [Did the Roshan team win the next fight?](https://whanyu1212.github.io/gem-dota/cookbook/roshan-next-fight) ·
  [How fast did each core farm from 10 to 20 minutes?](https://whanyu1212.github.io/gem-dota/cookbook/core-farm) ·
  [How often did a smoke lead to a kill?](https://whanyu1212.github.io/gem-dota/cookbook/smoke-to-kill)

The code lives in [`examples/cookbook/`](https://github.com/whanyu1212/gem-dota/tree/main/examples/cookbook):

```bash
python examples/cookbook/fights.py replays/*.dem
```

## Accuracy

gem is an independent Python implementation, checked against the
[Manta](https://github.com/dotabuff/manta), [Clarity](https://github.com/skadistats/clarity)
and [OpenDota](https://github.com/odota/parser) parsers at pinned revisions. On the
test replays and recent pro matches (most recently nine from October 2026), its per-player totals (K/D/A, last hits, net worth, GPM/XPM, hero and tower
damage, healing, wards, stacks, runes, buybacks) and per-minute gold, XP, last-hit and
deny curves match OpenDota exactly. Replays with an embedded postgame summary give
exact final gold, net worth and spending; older or incomplete replays fall back to
replay-derived values, and fields whose absence means something stay `None`.

Some outputs are reconstructed rather than recorded:

- Farming routes, smoke analysis, fight positioning and Roshan records are
  [experimental](https://whanyu1212.github.io/gem-dota/experimental/): they join replay
  facts with documented, inspectable rules.
- A truncated or corrupt replay returns what was read, with `parse_error` and
  `truncated_at_tick` set.
- Healing Lotus pickups aren't in the replay's event stream.

See [Replay Edge Cases](https://whanyu1212.github.io/gem-dota/deep-dives/replay-edge-cases)
for the details.

## Performance

gem is pure Python, built for research and batch analysis. A 40-minute professional
match parses in about a minute and a half on an Apple M2; `gem.parse_many()` spreads replays
across processes, and bounded Parquet export doesn't keep every finished match in
memory. The [performance study](https://whanyu1212.github.io/gem-dota/deep-dives/parser-performance)
has the method and numbers.
